In this workshop, you will spin up a [DigitalOcean Managed Kubernetes Cluster](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes). You will get a $100 credit for this workshop, and in order to [redeem the credit](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/billing/promo-codes/), you will need a DigitalOcean Account.

If you have an existing DigitalOcean account that has already used a promo code, we will have to manually add the credits to your account. There are two ways to handle this at the session: 

1. Share the email address associated with your account and we will manually apply the code after the workshop
    - send Kim Schlesinger a message in the [CNCF Slack](cloud-native.slack.com) and share the email address associated with your DigitalOcean account
